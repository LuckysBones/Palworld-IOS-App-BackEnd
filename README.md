Palworld iOS App Backend

Welcome to the Palworld iOS App Backend repository!

Description

This repository contains the backend for the Palworld iOS App. 
The backend is built using Django Channels and is Dockerized for consistent and scalable deployment. 
It connects to the Palworld REST API and communicates with the SwiftUI frontend via WebSockets for real-time data streaming. 
The backend runs both the Django Channels application and the Palworld server in separate Docker containers using Docker Compose. 
NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to enhance performance and security.

This setup leverages Palworld's REST API and WebSocket technologies to deliver a responsive, real-time user experience to the iOS app users.
